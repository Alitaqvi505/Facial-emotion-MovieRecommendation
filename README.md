Facial-emotion-MovieRecommendation is a full-stack application that recommends movies based on a user’s facial emotions detected in real time. The project integrates modern frontend development, a scalable backend, and an AI-powered emotion recognition model to deliver personalized recommendations.

The system captures facial input and processes it using a Python-based facial emotion recognition model, which identifies emotions such as happiness, sadness, anger, surprise, and neutrality. Based on the detected emotion, the system maps the result to relevant movie genres and generates suitable recommendations.

The backend is built using .NET 8.0, following a clean and scalable architecture. It exposes RESTful APIs that handle communication between the frontend and the AI model, manage recommendation logic, and ensure secure and efficient data flow. The backend acts as the central layer coordinating AI inference and application logic.

The frontend is developed with Angular, providing a responsive and intuitive user interface. Users can interact with the system to capture facial input, view detected emotions, and receive movie recommendations in real time. Angular’s component-based architecture ensures maintainability and scalability.

This project demonstrates strong full-stack software development skills, including Angular UI development, .NET backend engineering, and seamless AI integration using Python. It showcases how intelligent systems can be embedded into real-world applications to enhance user experience and personalization.
